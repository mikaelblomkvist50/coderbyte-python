Write a program that initializes the string `word = "echo"`, the empty tuple `t = ()`, and the integer `count = 3`. Then, write a sequence of commands by using commands you learned in this lesson to make `t = ("echo", "echo", "echo", "cho", "cho", "cho", "ho", "ho", "ho", "o", "o", "o")` and print it. The original word is added to the end of the tuple, and then the original word without the first letter is added to the tuple, and so on. Each substring of the original word gets repeated `count` numbers of time.
