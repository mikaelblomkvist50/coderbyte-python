This is your first interactive programming task, so let's have some fun with the user! You want to write a program that automatically combines two names given by the user. That's an open-ended problem statement, so let's add a few more details and restrictions:
* Tell the user to give you two names in the format FIRST LAST. 
* Show the user two possible new names in the format FIRST LAST. 
* The new first name is a combination of the first names given by the user, and the new last name is a combination of the last names given by the user. For example, if the user gives you `Alice Cat` and `Bob Dog`, a possible mashup is `Bolice Dot`.
